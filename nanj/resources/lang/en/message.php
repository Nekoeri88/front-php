        'Most of the virtual currencies so far have unclear possession ratios of "management team", such as possessing a majority. Therefore, the possession percentage of NANJCOIN management team was set to be <strong> 10% of the total. </strong> The merit of this is securing transparency, and even if the management team sells out, the market does not collapse because it does not exceed the majority. Of course, it will be a double countermeasure after clearly stating that you will not act like selling through and disturbing the market price at a stretch. In the open game, we plan to sell 18 billion NANJ, which is 60% of the total issue volume. After the end of the open game, Burn and lockup will be carried out for unsold tokens.',
